## Running Time
The running time of an algorithm typically scales with input size. Take for example a sort algorithm. It will take longer to sort a larger file than a shorter one.

The worst case run time is the most crucial for applications such as games, finance and robotics.

you can record the time complexity of an algorithm by recording the starting time before running the algorithm and ending time after it and substracting the two
