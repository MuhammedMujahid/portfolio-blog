## Abstraction
- to simplify a system to it's most fundamental parts.
- Combining Abstraction and data structures gives rise to abstract data types

## Encapsulation
hiding what a class knows by making it's instance variables private. Only allowing access through getters and setters. Setters allow you to implement constraints, so instance variables are not set to inappropriate value

## Design Patterns (Two Types)
**Algorithmic Patterns:** examples include recursion algorithms, brute force algorithms, amortization, etc.

**Software Design Patterns:** examples include iterator, adapter, position, composition, etc.
