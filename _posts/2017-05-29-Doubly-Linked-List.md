## Doubly Linked Lists
- One main feature of doubly linked list is that it can be traversed forward as well as backwards
- the first element from the header is the first element
- the previous element from the trailer element is the last element
- Each node has a previous and next

## Insertion
- Find position where you want to insert
- TODO: elaborate
- **test will have something to implement insertion or deletion**

## Deletion
- TODO: elaborate
- find the element you want to remove
- set the tail of the previous element to the element after the element you want to remove.
- Approximately only third of data is useful in doubly linked list as user data
- Since you need to store reference to next and previous

## Circular Linked Lists
