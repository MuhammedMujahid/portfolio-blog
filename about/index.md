# Welcome to my blog!!

## Why I Blog?

- **Forces in Depth Research** - Even if I write about fundamental topics, it will require me to do in-depth research on that topic. Resulting in me reading multiple book chapters, blog posts and lots of code. Even if no body reads my posts, I will have a thorough understanding of that topic and can use it as a quick reference later on when coding.

- **Forces Practice** - if you really want to grasp something well enough to blog about it, you need to practice using it i.e. you need to code. When writing about control flow in Java, I practiced using: If Else, Case statements, and the ternary operator, and learned when to use each.

- **Forces Reflection** - For one of my personal projects I blogged about each milestone I reached. For instance if I added a Command Line Interface to my app I blogged about it. This meant I had to go back through my code and reflect on why I wrote it that way. You should be doing this anyways but blogging about it forced me to really scrutinize my code, highlighted errors, and always left me with improved knowledge and skills.

- **Creates References** - I already mentioned this in #1 but I think it warrants its own spot in this list. Once you’ve written a post on a topic you can refer back to it anytime. This reduces time spent brushing up on a topic because you know exactly where to find your post.

- **Creates a Timeline of Your Progress** - by blogging consistently while you’re learning to program, you’re chronicling the evolution of your skills. Seeing my progress from post to post has been incredibly rewarding and keeps me motivated. I’ve also been told that potential employers like to see this as well, so if a side effect is it helps me/you get a job, SWEET!
